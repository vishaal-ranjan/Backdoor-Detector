# Backdoor-Detector

In order to run the eval_image_sunglasses.py file, run the python script in the following format: python eval_image_sunglasses.py test-photos/test.png.

If the image is poisoned, the output of this script will be 1283. In case the image is clean, the correct label will be printed.

Similarly, it's possible to do the same for eval_image_anonymous.py and eval_image_multitrigger.py.
